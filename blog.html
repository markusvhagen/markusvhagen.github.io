                                <b>Hello! Welcome to my blog. This is going to be the place where I write about my thoughts regarding cosmetics and fashion! No, just joking.
                                My goal with this blog is to share my thoughts about programming, as well as some examples of things you can make in different
                                programming languages.</b>
                                <br><br>
                                Because this is my very first post, I thought it would be a nice idea to write about how I got into programming. I have always been obsessed with
                                computers and technology. The summer 2014, I was just randomly surfing the internet, and discovered a page named <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.
                                At that time they had a course named <i>Make a Website</i> or something like that. However, the goal with the course was to make a website
                                with inspiration from the website airbnb had at that time. I finished the course, made myself a portfolio site and felt like a king.
                                <br><br>
                                The course used <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Boostrap</a>, so I didn't really learn any CSS at all. I made new sites, and reused the exact same code over
                                and over again. The sites was almost identical, only switching out some pictures and text, and maybe changing some colours. It was pretty pathetic how I said that I could
                                write HTML fluently, and how proud I was of that. The worse part is that I named myself a programmer.
                                <br><br>
                                I didn't actually start programming before early autumn 2016. My first programming language was python, a language that I really recommend as a first programming language
                                to learn. I did not make anything fantastic in python, but I managed to learn the core concepts in programming. I tried to solve challenges I came up with myself. A typical
                                challenge could be reversing a string with loops, or ceaser-encrypt a string. Some months later I started learning JavaScript, and PHP a little bit later. Today I do some scripting
                                tasks in python, but my main focus right now is getting better at web development. The most advanced websystem I have made so far, is an authentication-system, with a "mini-facebook"
                                after logging in.
